This project is intentionally not intended for casual download and use for obvious reasons. It was simply a weekend project to scratch a personal itch. No binaries or explicit instructions will be provided and you will need to configure your personal oauth access tokens and api keys. Minimal instructions for use are provided.

It leverages the YouTube API to access your playlists and allow saving select videos locally along with the transcript if provided and video description as well as top 100 *(if that many)* comments *(useful for tutorials)*. It should not be seen as a typical video downloader as the use cache is niche. It also provides a minimal web interface for browsing your local video stash.
